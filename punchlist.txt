Punchlist:

I think the "Slava Ukraini" splash screen is probably redundant now with the modified UKR grainfield screen that follows. Maybe it looks a little impressive though??

It would probably be best to open the window centered within the physical screen instead of jammed in the upper left corner.

The joptionpanel to get the player name would be better to have within the preceding "grainfield" frame. 

The Instruction screen should be larger. 

The right/wrong popup message window should disappear after 2 seconds so the player doesn't need to click to dismiss it.

The Good & Bad buttons should be overlayed on the logo not off to the side

The score should be displayed continuously

The final score screen should be displayed when complete
Ideally a leaderboard of past scores. Maybe this is a bridge too far considering our timeframe. Though it wouldn't be very difficult to write the players name and score out to a csv since we've done that type of thing for homework in this class. 

Some nice message should be crafted for the end screen maybe with the theme of being an ethical consumer. 
  e.g. Which side are you taking in your everyday purchase choices?
  
It would  be nice to have a backgroud pic for the end like the opening grainfield. Anyone have some creative thoughts for the last screen?
